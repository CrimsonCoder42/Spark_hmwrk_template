It also addresses other related issues, such as modifying the formulas for calculating such user fees and reauthorizing various programs. (The FDA collects user fees from various entities, including companies that produce drugs and medical devices. The total amounts generated by each user fee program are set out in statutes. Generally, the FDA negotiates these user fees with the relevant industry every five years.)</p> <p>TITLE I--FEES RELATING TO DRUGS</p> <p><em>Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 1002) This section modifies various definitions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Specifically, it modifies the definition of <em>human drug application</em> to include applications for certain allergenic extract products licensed on or after October 1, 2022.</p> <p>For the purposes of assessing the prescription drug program fee, if a drug manufacturer makes a request for a particular prescription drug to be placed on the list for discontinued drugs, the FDA shall consider the drug discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later.</p> <p>This section also establishes a statutory definition for <em>skin-test diagnostic product</em>. Generally, such a product is administered to the skin to detect a local hypersensitivity reaction to aid the diagnosis of an allergy or infection with certain pathogens.</p> <p>(Sec. 1003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments. (The base revenue and various adjustments set the total amount of user fees that the FDA must collect through the particular user fee program each fiscal year.)</p> <p>For the purposes of setting drug user fees, the FDA must make various adjustments including (1) increasing the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjusting the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees for FY2021.</p> <p>This section also establishes that a human drug application for a skin-test diagnostic product shall not be subject to certain fees.</p> <p>Furthermore, this section establishes a rule for fees for an approved human prescription drug that was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the same fiscal year. Generally, the relevant manufacturers of such a drug must pay the annual prescription drug program fee for that fiscal year, if the manufacturer has had a human drug application or supplement pending before the FDA after September 1, 1992.</p> <p>This section also modifies exemptions to the prescription drug program fees for certain drugs.

(Medical devices are assigned to one of three classes based on the level of control necessary to assure the device's safety and effectiveness.)</p> <p>(Sec. 2003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses medical device user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, the section establishes the total revenue amounts to be generated from such fees for each fiscal year through FY2027.</p> <p>For the purpose of calculating such user fees, this section also authorizes increases for various purposes. For example, for FY2025-FY2027, the base establishment registration fee amounts shall be increased by specified amounts to meet improved performance goals for reviewing certain medical device applications. Other adjustments required by this section include decreases in the amount to be collected for such user fees if (1) the FDA's hiring to support the medical device application process is below certain thresholds, or (2) operating reserves for medical device application review operations exceed certain thresholds.</p> <p>(Sec. 2005) This section permanently reauthorizes and modifies a program under which accredited testing laboratories are involved in assessing whether a medical device complies with certain statutory requirements. Currently, such a laboratory shall assess whether a device conforms to the relevant requirements. Under this section, a laboratory shall conduct tests to support such assessments.</p> <p>(Sec. 2006) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, a program that allows accredited persons to review reports and make recommendations to the FDA pertaining to the initial classification of medical devices.</p> <p>(Sec. 2007) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to medical devices, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE III--FEES RELATING TO GENERIC DRUGS<br> <em><br> Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 3002) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses generic drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue amount and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year for the particular user fee program.</p> <p>The FDA must establish a capacity planning methodology to meet the resource capacity needed for the FDA's human generic drug activities and increase the revenue collected under this user fee program accordingly.</p> <p>The FDA may also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's human generic drug activities. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.</p> <p>(Sec. 3004) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human generic drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE IV--FEES RELATING TO BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS</p> <p><em>Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022</em></p> <p>(Sec. 4002) This section amends the definition of <em>biosimilar biological product application </em>to include a qualifying application for an allergenic extract product. Currently, applications for allergenic extract products are specifically excluded from the definition.</p> <p>(Sec. 4003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses biosimilar biological product user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year through the user fee program.</p> <p>For the purposes of setting such user fees, the FDA must (1) increase the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjust the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees in FY2021.</p> <p>The FDA must also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year if doing so is necessary to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's review of biosimilar biological product applications. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.</p> <p>The section also makes other changes to the biosimilar user fees, including by (1) authorizing the FDA to administratively remove from the biosimilar biological product development program a person who has failed to pay the required fee for two consecutive years, and (2) eliminating the biosimilar biological product fee.</p> <p>Furthermore, for the purposes of assessing the biosimilar biological product program fee, if a biosimilar product manufacturer makes a request for a particular biosimilar product to be placed on a list for discontinued products, the FDA shall consider the product discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later.</p> <p>If an approved biosimilar product was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the fiscal year, the manufacturer of the product must pay the annual biosimilar biological product program fee for that fiscal year.</p> <p>(Sec. 4005) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to biosimilar biological products, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.</p> <p>TITLE V--REAUTHORIZATION OF OTHER PROVISIONS</p> <p>(Sec. 5001) This section reauthorizes a National Institutes of Health program to (1) develop and publish a priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics, and (2) award funds to entities with expertise in conducting research regarding such needs.</p> <p>(Sec. 5002) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, the humanitarian device exemption program, which authorizes the FDA to, for the purposes of an application for approval to market a medical device, waive certain effectiveness requirements for an eligible device designed to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that affects no more than 8,000 individuals in the United States. Specifically, a request for such an exemption must be submitted on or before December 17, 2022.</p> <p>(Sec. 5003) This section reauthorizes a program that provides grants or contracts to nonprofit consortia for demonstration projects to promote pediatric device development.</p> <p>(Sec. 5004) This section reauthorizes a provision that allows an applicant for market approval for an eligible single-enantiomer drug to make an election that may qualify the drug for a five-year market exclusivity period.</p> <p>(Sec. 5005) This section reauthorizes the Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships, through which the FDA may enter into collaborative agreements with eligible entities to develop projects designed to achieve certain goals, such as fostering medical product innovation and accelerating medical product development.</p> <p>(Sec. 5006) This section reauthorizes an FDA program that provides grants to defray the costs of developing drugs, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases or conditions.</p> <p>(Sec. 5007) This section extends through December 17, 2022, a provision requiring the FDA to accredit persons to inspect facilities that manufacture certain classes of medical devices.</p> <p>(Sec. 5008) This section reauthorizes a provision requiring the FDA to post on its website quarterly reports with information on received generic drug applications and priority review applications.</p> <p>DIVISION G--HERMIT'S PEAK/CALF CANYON FIRE ASSISTANCE ACT</p> <p><em>Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act</em></p> <p>This division provides for monetary compensation to the persons injured by the prescribed fire burn in the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico that became a wildfire known as the Hermit's Peak Fire or the Hermit's Peak Fire/Calf Canyon Fire.</p> <p>Each person injured as a result the Hermit's Peak Fire shall be eligible to receive monetary compensation from the United States, including for personal injury, loss of property, business loss, or financial loss.</p> <p>An Office of Hermit's Peak Fire Claims is established within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to receive, process, and pay claims from persons injured by the fire.</p> <p>FEMA or the independent claims manager (which FEMA may appoint) shall, on behalf of the United States, investigate, consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, grant, deny, or settle any claim for money damages asserted by a person injured by the Hermit's Peak Fire.</p> <p>Any claimant aggrieved by a final decision of FEMA concerning compensation may, not later than 60 days after the date on which the decision is issued, bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico to modify or set aside the decision.</p>"
